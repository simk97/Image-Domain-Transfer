# Image-Domain-Transfer
Image domain transfer includes methods that transform an image based on an example, commonly used in photorealistic and artistic style transfer, as well as learning-based methods that learn a transfer function based on a training set.
Here we use the pre trained VGG16 Model to achieve this goal by providing an input image and a style image to obtain an stylized output image.
